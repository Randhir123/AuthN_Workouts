# Workout 11 — Meeting the Identity Provider

## What we’re doing

Familiarize yourself with the IBM Security Verify admin console and identify where identity-related responsibilities live. This workout is orientation only—no resources are created yet.

1. Log in to your Verify admin console: `https://<tenant>.verify.ibm.com`
2. Explore the left navigation:
   - **Applications**
   - **Security**
   - **Access policies**
   - **Directory**
3. Note what each area controls and how it maps to concepts from Part 1 (issuers, tokens, verification logic).

## Why it matters

An identity provider is a system you delegate authority to. Before configuring anything, you must understand its shape and boundaries. Knowing where applications, policies, and directories live helps you reason about future changes and trust boundaries.

*Do not create anything yet—this workout is purely orientation.*
