# AuthN Workouts

AuthN_Workouts is a hands-on series that rebuilds authentication from first principles, showing how request-level checks evolve into centrally enforced identity, assurance, delegation, and privacy-preserving proof.

- [Part I — Requests, Tokens, and Trust Boundaries](part1/README.md): workouts 1–10.
- [Part 2 — Introducing an Identity Provider: IBM Security Verify](part2/README.md): upcoming workouts that integrate a managed IdP.

Start with Part I and work through each workout in order; the mental model compounds across the series.
